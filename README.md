### Code for seagrass multi-stressor field experiment <br />

**About** <br />
This repository contains the data and code to analyse experimental data collected from a multiple stressor field experiment. <br />

**Summary** <br />
Multiple stressors are ubiquitous in the environment and can degrade ecosystem structure and function. Manipulative experiments aim to identify complex stressor interactions and how they impact the environment, yet we continue to introduce stressors under highly controlled static conditions, despite environmental conditions within ecosystems constantly changing. This approach might lead to inaccurate experimental conclusions and predictions of cumulative stressor effects. Therefore, we test how a seagrass meadow and associated invertebrate community respond to fluctuating (both synchronous and asynchronous) stressors in situ, and are interested in comparing responses to those observed under static stressor conditions. Furthermore, we investigate how stressor effects can be mediated across trophic levels within a seagrass community.

### AO update
Revised code for analyses. Added: 1) hypothesised DAGs and steps for testing data consistencey and adjustment sets, 2) GAM SEM for final model and the remaining two plausible models, 3) GAMs for total effects on individual responses.
