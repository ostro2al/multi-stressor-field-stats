**Code for seagrass multi-stressor field experiment** <br />

**About** <br />
This repository contains the data and code to analyse experimental data collected from a multiple stressor field experiment. <br />

**Summary** <br />
Multiple stressors are ubiquitous in the environment and can degrade ecosystem structure and function. Manipulative experiments aim to identify complex stressor interactions and how they impact the environment, yet we continue to introduce stressors under highly controlled static conditions, despite environmental conditions within ecosystems constantly changing. This approach might lead to inaccurate experimental conclusions and predictions of cumulative stressor effects. Therefore, we test how a seagrass meadow and associated invertebrate community respond to fluctuating (both synchronous and asynchronous) stressors in situ, and are interested in comparing responses to those observed under static stressor conditions.

**TODO List** <br />
Review GAMs and SEMs used to analyse data thus far <br />

Explore changes in temporal variance and variance across treatmetns <br />



### CB Notes

 Look at mulitple trophic levels with SEM
 Look at changes in temporal variance (what is our hypothesis? more
 variance with fluctating? Also more variance with
 in sync than out of sync? )
 How to model that, with GAM and look at DF smooth?

 What about changes in variance across treatments?

 Framing around local vs regional stressors.
 MGMT action easier on the bait pumping. So
 decision could be around when can pumping have
 least impact on SG, does it matter if it occurs
 near floods?
 So frame as manageable vs unmanageable stressor problem
 
 
 ### AO comments on CB notes <br />
 
 Added some initial trial SEM code to look at mechanistic effects. <br />
 
 I like the idea of looking into changes in temporal variance and variance across treatments. <br />
 I would hypothesise greater variation in fluctuating treatments relative to static, with greater variance over time. <br />
 
 I also like the idea of discussing local stressor management, how physical disturbance can have greater impact on seagrass 
 during flooding and/or eutrophication events, for example. Will plan to discuss in paper.
