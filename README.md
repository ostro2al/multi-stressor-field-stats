**#Code for seagrass multi-stressor field experiment**

**##About**
This repository contains the data and code to analyse experimental data collected from a multiple stressor field experiment.

**##Summary**
Multiple stressors are ubiquitous in the environment and can degrade ecosystem structure and function. Manipulative experiments aim to identify complex stressor interactions and how they impact the environment, yet we continue to introduce stressors under highly controlled static conditions despite environmental conditions within ecosystems constantly changing. This approach might lead to inaccurate experimental conclusions and predictions of cumulative stressor effects. Therefore, we test how a seagrass meadow and associated invertebrate community respond to fluctating (both synchronous and asynchronous) stressors in situ, and are interested in comparing responses to those observed under static stressor conditions.

**##TODO List**
Review lmer models used to analyse data thus far

Explore different types of models other than lmer (e.g., GAMs) to analyse results

Look into types of multivariate analyses we can run (e.g., SEM?)
